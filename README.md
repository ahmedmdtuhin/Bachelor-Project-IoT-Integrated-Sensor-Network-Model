# IoT Integrated Sensor Network for Smart Agriculture

This repository contains the final Bachelor's thesis report for a hardware-based **IoT-integrated smart agriculture system**. The system collects soil and environmental data using various sensors and provides real-time insights and recommendations for precision farming.

## 📄 Project Overview

The system is designed to assist farmers and agricultural officers in monitoring critical environmental conditions and making informed decisions. It supports both **SMS-based** alerts and **cloud-based monitoring** via **ThingSpeak**.

### 🔧 Key Components

- **Arduino Mega 2560** – Main microcontroller
- **NodeMCU ESP32** – Wi-Fi-based IoT module for cloud connectivity (ThingSpeak)
- **GSM A6 Module** – Sends SMS alerts to farmers and agricultural officers
- **PH Sensor** – Measures soil acidity/alkalinity
- **DHT22 Sensor** – Captures humidity and temperature
- **Light Intensity Sensor** – Monitors sunlight level
- **Ultrasonic Pest Repellent** – Reduces need for chemical pesticides
- **Solar Power Supply** – Sustainable and field-deployable energy solution
- **16×2 LCD Display** – Shows live sensor data and farming instructions

## 📡 Communication & Monitoring

- 📲 **SMS Alerts**: Farmers receive soil condition, weather forecast, and fertilizer suggestions via mobile SMS. Also, required instructions are provided.
- ☁️ **ThingSpeak Cloud**: All sensor data is sent to ThingSpeak for real-time IoT data visualization, accessible by agricultural officers and researchers.

## 📁 Included in this Repository
